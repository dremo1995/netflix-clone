# Filmpire

### Description

Filmpire is a Movie management application where a user is able to log in and search for movies, Add them to a personal watchlist, and Favorite them. Each movie will have descriptions, ratings, genres, and it's actors along with description pages for each of the actors. I have also implemented some simple voice command capabilities with Alan AI (https://alan.app/docs/)

### What I learned...

This project taught me how to implement voice commands on a web application, how Redux is used to connect a public api to your project.
